# QStarterApp
A starter app for new projects, to avoid the hassle of setting stuff up when prototyping something.


Created a new application that contains some boilerplate stuff that I usually need either when I prototype something or when I actually start a new project.

Features:
 - Based on Qt
 - Contains a simple Mersenne Twister based number generator
 - Parses command line arguments
 - sends somes signals 
 - turns off application in case wrong params are passed
